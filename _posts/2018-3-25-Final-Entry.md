**What did you like the least about the class?**
The first couple of projects can feel frustrating as you're being dropped into the deep end. My group had no experience whatsoever with web development, so most of the time spent on early projects involved just figuring out how to get basic tthings to work.

**What did you like the most about the class?**
I loved how reewarding the project was. You spend the entire year working towards a real, tangible goal, and seeing that website up at the end is a great feeling. Everything you learn over the course of the projects is also very practical and applicable.

**What's the most significant thing you learned?**
For me, the most signicifant thing that I learned was how to create and call an API to communicate with a backend database. I had already known a decent amount of SQL, but the classes that taught me SQL neveer gave me a chance to use a database in any practical manner.

**How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?**
I'd say that I spent probably around 15 hours a week coding for the class. This number would go way up when a deadline was approaching.

**How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?**
Not much at all, maybe 3 hours. The reading is light and pretty easy.

**How many lines of code do you think you wrote?**
Somewhere around 1000-1500? It's very difficult to get an estimate on that.

**What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?**
Flask. Flask simplifies website building so much. It was the backbone of our project and it held up extremely well.

**What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?**
Flask-restless made API creation incredibly simple and intuitive. What could have been very difficult was made incredibly easy for us.

**If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?**
Some added guidance witht he project could help - at the moment, what you're given is a page of requirements and sometimes required tools. Though, I guess that's just software engineering. Maybe that shouldn't be changed.
