**What are your expectations for this class?**
I hope to gain a better understanding of the software development process through this course. I also hope to pick up a bit of SQL knowledge here to make me a more well rounded developer, and to learn more about time management and working with a group on a large project.

**What did you do this past week?**
I unfortunately had to miss class due to the sudden cold and rain leaving me stuck with my family in Oklahoma, so I've had a lot of free time on my hands. I've been helping my girlfriend prepare for interviews and look for jobs, as well as practicing myself. We're hoping to stay in Austin post graduation, so we are both working hard to make that a possibility with no family here to fall back on.

**What's in your way?**
I'm taking a fairly heavy courseload with three CS classes - this one, ethical hacking, and network security. I imagine that I'll be pretty busy this semester! On top of this, I'm busy looking for jobs, which can of course be very stressful. On the grand scale of things though, this seems like a pretty decend set of problems to have, and I think they are more just hurdles to overcome rather than things in my way.

**What will you do next week?**
Probably more of the same but with way more classwork. I don't have anything big planned personally, so hopefully it will be a pretty relaxed week. I feel like there are always things to worry about right now, but I feel that things will smooth out greatly once I find a job and can relax a bit. One day I'd even like my net worth to not be in the negatives!

**What's my experience of the class?**
I still haven't been to class! But I'm here now, and I hear that the class is difficult and pretty intimidating. I also hear that people get called out a lot, so that worries me. I always feel that I forget the answers to questions immediately once I'm called on out of nowhere. We'll see though.

**What's my pick-of-the-week?**
Pick up an Arduino or Raspberry Pi! They are cheap and tons of fun to mess around with, so long as you have an idea in mind. My stepbrother uses one to emulate older games, and in the past I've taught kids to use them to make their stuffed animals wave limbs around or detect movement. Programming an Arduino or Raspberry Pi to do basic things is extremely easy, and it's fun to use hardware pieces like motors and sensors sometimes.
