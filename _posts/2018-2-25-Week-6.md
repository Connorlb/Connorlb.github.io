**What did you do this past week?**
This past week wasn't such a bad one. I started working with my network security group on the next CTF assignment, which is going alright. I also went to check out the new asian supermarket called hmart that just moved in to Austin, which was ridiculous. The store itself was awesome, super clean and had a huge selection. Unfortunately, because it was new and because we had no other nice asian supermarkets around here before, it was INSANELY busy. I could barely push our shopping cart around the store.

**What's in your way?**
The upcoming test is in my way! I'm very worried about that because some of the in class quizzes have been very tricky, and I've bombed a couple. It seems like I'll probably have to study a lot for this test.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I'll work on the upcoming project, wrap up my network security project, and be thankful that the test is now in the past. Spring break is coming up, so I guess I'll also make plans for that. It's not something I've thought about a whole lot so far, though.

**What's your experience of this class?**
My experience of the class hasn't really changed. I think that it's a stressful, but useful class. It takes a lot of my time but I'm glad to be taking it. I'm very curious to see what the test will be like, as I still haven't seen one in this class yet. I'm thankful that my other classes are going easy on tests this semester so I can focus more on this class.

**What's your pick of the week?**
If you're in Ethical Hacking and still looking for a wireless adapter, the Alfa AWUS036NHA has worked excellently for me. The NEH variant probably works too, and looks better, but I've heard that it is much less reliable. Also, if you haven't read the piazza page, the tiny panda wireless adapters no longer support packet injection, so those won't work at all. Don't get one!
